# Traffic Project
## Traffic Analysis Project for Code Louisville

Data should answer a question for you right?  I want to use my experience in learning programming to answer one I've had in my head for years:

### Are people more dangerous drivers now then when I first started driving?

To try to answer this question I'll start by doing a data comparison on a city's traffic accidents and incidents.  Since I would expect a natural increase in this amount over time I'll also visualise the data alongside the city's population growth. If I have time I'll also try this comparison on other cities to see if I can see the same, if any, trend in the data.

I expect to compare monthly and yearly traffic conditions to graph a chart of the increase of said incidents over time.  I also would be interested if I can find data on a small enough scale
to see how this data graphs through the week and maybe even the day.

I will start by researching this on my home city since it's where I ask this question almost daily: Louisville.

# Project journal
- Week 1
I can already see from researching the data I want to use that this will be challenging to present.  While I seem to have found consisent data in the population information from census.gov the governments of the different cities each share their data in different ways. The Louisville data seems to be the easiest to work with.  If I have time to solve the challenge I get to pull the data out of the websites for the other two cities.  If I spent more time researching I could likely find cleaner data to work with but I'll acomplish my goal with the Louisville data and succeeding or failing in the others will at least get me more experience coding.
