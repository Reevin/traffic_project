# Traffic Project
## Traffic Analysis Project for Code Louisville

Data should answer a question for you right?  I want to use my experience in learning programming to answer one I've had in my head for years:

### Are people more dangerous drivers now then when I first started driving?

I could just as well answer this question by looking at national historical traffic data but I would like to see what conclusions I can on my own.  To try to answer this question I'll start by doing a data comparison on a city's traffic accidents and incidents.  If it is still within my schedule I'll also try this comparison on other cities to see if I can see the same, if any, trend in the data.

I expect to compare monthly and yearly traffic conditions to graph a chart of the increase of said incidents over time.  I also would be interested if I can find data on a small enough scale to see how this data graphs through the week and maybe even the day.  I will start by researching this on my home city since it's where I ask this question almost daily: Louisville.
